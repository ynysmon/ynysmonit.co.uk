<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Personal data&rdquo; is any information about a living individual which allows them to be identified from that data (for example a name, photographs, videos, email address, or address).<br />Identification can be directly using the data itself or by combining it with other information which helps to identify a living individual (e.g. a list of staff may contain personnel ID numbers rather than names but if you use a separate list of the ID numbers which give the corresponding names to identify the staff in the first list then the first list will also be treated as personal data).<br />The processing of personal data is governed by legislation relating to personal data which applies in the United Kingdom including the General Data Protection Regulation (the &ldquo;GDPR) and other legislation relating to personal data and rights such as the Human Rights Act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Who are we?</strong></span><br />This Privacy Notice is provided to you by the Ynys Mon IT which is the data controller for your data.<br />Other data controllers we work with include e.g.:<br />&bull; Other data controllers<br />&bull; Community groups &bull; Charities<br />&bull; Other not for profit entities<br />&bull; Contractors<br />&bull; Credit reference agencies<br />We may need to share your personal data we hold with them so that they can carry out their responsibilities.
